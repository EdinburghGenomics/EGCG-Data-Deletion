<h3>Bioinformatics analysis</h3>
Demultiplexing is performed using bcl2fastq ({{bcl2fastq_version}}), allowing 1 mismatch when assigning reads
to barcodes. Adapters (Read1: {{adapter1}}, Read2: {{adapter2}}) are trimmed during the demultiplexing
process. BCBio-Nextgen ({{bcbio_version}}) is used to perform alignment, bam file preparation and variant
detection. BCBio uses bwa mem ({{bwa_version}}) to align the raw reads to the {{genome_name}}
({{genome_version}}) genome, then samblaster ({{samblaster_version}}) to mark the duplicated fragments, and
the Genome Analysis ToolKit ({{gatk_version}}) for the indel realignment and base recalibration. The genotype
likelihoods are calculated using Genome Analysis Toolkit ({{gatk_version}}) HaplotypeCaller creating a final
gvcf file.
