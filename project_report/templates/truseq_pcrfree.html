<h2>Sample QC</h2>
<h5>Genomic DNA (gDNA) samples are evaluated for quantity using Quant-iT Picogren reagent, Lambda Standard
DNA and a Molecular Devices, Spectramax XPS Gemini plate reader.  The quality of the gDNA samples are
evaluated using an AATI Fragment Analyzer and the Standard Sensitivity Genomic DNA Analysis Kit. Genomic DNA
samples found to have a total amount of >2500ng and a quality score >5 would pass sample QC. Based on
the quantification results, gDNA samples are pre-normalised to fall within the 20-100ng/uL concentration
range required for Illumina SeqLab TruSeq PCR-Free library preparation method using the Hamilton MicroLab STAR.</h5>

{% block library_prep %}
<h2>Library Preparation</h2>
<h5>Next Generation sequencing libraries are prepared using Illumina SeqLab specific TruSeq PCR Free
High Throughput library preparation kits in conjunction with the Hamilton MicroLab STAR and Clarity
LIMS X (4.2?)  Edition. The 1000ng gDNA sample input is normalised to the concentration and volume
required for the Illumina TruSeq PCR-Free library preparation kit, then sheared to a 450bp mean insert
size using a Covaris LE220 focused-ultrasonicator. The inserts are blunt ended, A-tailed, size selected and
the TruSeq adapters are ligated onto the ends.</h5>

{% block library_qc %}
<h2>Library QC</h2>
<h5>The insert size for each library is evaluated after shearing using the Caliper GX Touch with a
HT DNA 1k/12K/HI SENS LabChip and HT DNA HI SENS Reagent Kit to ensure that the mean fragment sizes
fall between 300bp and 750bp. The concentration of each library is established using a Roche LightCycler
480 and a Kapa Illumina Library Quantification kit and Standards to ensure that each
libraries concentration is between 3.5nM and 20nM.</h5>

{% block sequencing %}
<h2>Sequencing</h2>
<h5>Sequencing: Illumina TruSeq PCR Free Library Preparation
The libraries are normalised to 0.75nM and are denatured for clustering and sequencing at 150pM using a
Hamilton MicroLab STAR with Genologics Clarity LIMS X (4.2?) Edition. Libraries are clustered onto a
HiSeqX Flow cell v2.5 on cBot2s and the clustered flow cell is transferred to a HiSeqX for sequencing
using a HiSeqX Ten Reagent kit v2.5.</h5>
