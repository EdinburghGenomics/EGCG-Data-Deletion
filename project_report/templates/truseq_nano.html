<h2>Library Preparation</h2>
<h5>Next Generation sequencing libraries are prepared using an Illumina SeqLab TruSeq Nano High Throughput library
preparation kit. The gDNA samples are normalised to the concentration and volume required for the Illumina TruSeq
Nano library preparation kit, then sheared to a 450bp mean insert size using a Covaris LE220 focused-ultrasonicator.
The inserts are blunt ended, size selected, A-tailed and TruSeq adapters ligated  before being enriched with 6 cycles
of PCR amplification.</h5>

{% block library_qc %}
<h2>Library QC</h2>
<h5>The libraries are evaluated for mean fragment size using the Caliper GX Touch with a HT DNA 1k/12K/HI SENS LabChip
and HT DNA HI SENS Reagent Kit. The libraries are then quantified using a Roche LightCycler 480 and a Kapa Illumina
Library Quantification kit and Standards.</h5>

{% block sequencing %}
<h2>Sequencing</h2>
<h5>The libraries are normalised, denatured, and prepared for the clustering reaction. Libraries are
clustered onto HiSeqX Flow cell v2.5 on cBot2s and the clustered flow cell is transferred to a
HiSeqX for sequencing using a HiSeqX Ten Reagent kit v2.5.</h5>
