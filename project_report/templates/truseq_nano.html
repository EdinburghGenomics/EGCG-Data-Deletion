<h2>Sample QC</h2>
<h5>Genomic DNA (gDNA) samples are evaluated for quantity using Quant-iT Picogren reagent, Lambda Standard DNA
and a Molecular Devices, Spectramax XPS Gemini plate reader.  The quality of the gDNA samples are evaluated
using an AATI Fragment Analyzer and the Standard Sensitivity Genomic DNA Analysis Kit. Genomic DNA samples
found to have a total amount of >1000ng and a quality score >5 pass sample QC. Based on the quantification results,
gDNA samples are pre-normalised to fall within the 5-40ng/uL concentration range required for Illumina SeqLab
TruSeq Nano library preparation method using the Hamilton MicroLab STAR.</h5>

{% block library_prep %}
<h2>Library Preparation</h2>
<h5>Next Generation sequencing libraries are prepared using an Illumina SeqLab specific TruSeq Nano High
Throughput library preparation kit in conjunction with the Hamilton MicroLab STAR and Clarity LIMS X (4.2?)
Edition. The 200ng gDNA sample input is normalised to the concentration and volume required for the Illumina
TruSeq Nano library preparation kit, then sheared to a 450bp mean insert size using a Covaris LE220
focused-ultrasonicator. The inserts are blunt ended, A-tailed, size selected, TruSeq adapters are ligated
onto the ends of each fragment before being PCR amplified.</h5>

<h2>Library QC</h2>
<h5>The insert size for each library is evaluated using the Caliper GX Touch with a HT DNA 1k/12K/HI SENS LabChip
and HT DNA HI SENS Reagent Kit to ensure that the mean fragment sizes fall between 530bp and 730bp.
The concentration of each library is calculated using a Roche LightCycler 480 and a Kapa Illumina Library
Quantification kit and Standards to ensure that each libraries concentration is between 5.5nM and 40nM.</h5>
{% endblock %}

{% block sequencing %}
<h2>Sequencing</h2>
<h5>The libraries are normalised to 1.5nM and are denatured for clustering and sequencing at 300pM using a
Hamilton MicroLab STAR with Genologics Clarity LIMS X (4.2?) Edition. Libraries are clustered onto a
HiSeqX Flow cell v2.5 on cBot2s and the clustered flow cell is transferred to a HiSeqX for sequencing
using a HiSeqX Ten Reagent kit v2.5.</h5>
