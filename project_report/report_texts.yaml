method_header: >-
  Edinburgh Genomics: Clinical Genomics utilises Illumina SeqLab, which integrates Illumina TruSeq
  library preparation, Illumina cBot2 cluster generation, Illumina HiSeqX sequencing, Hamilton
  Microlab STAR integrative automation, and Genologics Clarity LIMS X Edition.

sample_qc: >-
  Genomic DNA (gDNA) samples are evaluated for quantity using Quant-iT Picogreen reagent, Lambda Standard 
  DNA and a Molecular Devices, Spectramax XPS Gemini plate reader.  The quality of the gDNA samples are evaluated 
  using an AATI Fragment Analyzer and the Standard Sensitivity Genomic DNA Analysis Kit. Genomic DNA samples 
  found to have a total amount of >-1000ng and a quality score >-5 pass sample QC. Based on the quantification results, 
  gDNA samples are pre-normalised to fall within the 5-40ng/uL concentration range required for Illumina SeqLab 
  TruSeq Nano library preparation method using the Hamilton MicroLab STAR.

library_preparation_nano: >-
  Next Generation sequencing libraries are prepared using an Illumina SeqLab specific 
  TruSeq Nano High Throughput library preparation kit in conjunction with the Hamilton MicroLab STAR and 
  Clarity LIMS X (4.2) Edition. The 200ng gDNA sample input is normalised to the concentration and volume required for 
  the Illumina TruSeq Nano library preparation kit, then sheared to a 450bp mean insert size using a Covaris LE220 
  focused-ultrasonicator. The inserts are blunt ended, A-tailed, size selected, TruSeq adapters are ligated 
  onto the ends of each fragment before being PCR amplified.

library_qc_nano: >-
  The insert size for each library is evaluated using the Caliper GX Touch with a HT DNA 1k/12K/HI 
  SENS LabChip and HT DNA HI SENS Reagent Kit to ensure that the mean fragment sizes fall between 530bp and 950bp. 
  The concentration of each library is calculated using a Roche LightCycler 480 and a Kapa Illumina Library 
  Quantification kit and Standards to ensure that the concentration of each library is 
  between 5.5nM and 40nM.

library_preparation_pcr_free: >-
  Next Generation sequencing libraries are prepared using Illumina SeqLab specific 
  TruSeq PCR-Free High Throughput library preparation kits in conjunction with the Hamilton MicroLab STAR and 
  Clarity LIMS X Edition. The gDNA samples are normalised to the concentration and volume required for the Illumina 
  TruSeq PCR-Free library preparation kits then sheared to a 450bp mean insert size using a Covaris LE220 
  focused-ultrasonicator. The inserts are blunt ended, A-tailed, size selected and the TruSeq adapters are ligated onto 
  the ends.

library_qc_pcr_free: >-
  The insert size for each library is evaluated using the Caliper GX Touch with a HT DNA 
  1k/12K/HI SENS LabChip  and HT DNA HI SENS Reagent Kit to ensure that the mean fragment sizes fall between 300bp and 
  800bp. The concentration of each library is calculated using a Roche LightCycler 480 and a Kapa Illumina Library 
  Quantification kit and Standards to ensure that the concentration of each library is between 1.1nM and 
  8nM.

sequencing: >-
  The libraries are normalised to 1.5nM and are denatured for clustering and sequencing at 300pM using a 
  Hamilton MicroLab STAR with Genologics Clarity LIMS X (4.2) Edition. Libraries are clustered onto a HiSeqX Flow cell 
  v2.5 on cBot2s and the clustered flow cell is transferred to a HiSeqX for sequencing using a HiSeqX Ten 
  Reagent kit v2.5.

bioinformatics_qc: >-
  Demultiplexing is performed using bcl2fastq ({bcl2fastq_version}), allowing 1 mismatch when 
  assigning reads to barcodes. Adapters (Read1:  {adapter1}, Read2:  {adapter2}) are trimmed during the demultiplexing 
  process. Bwa mem ({bwa_version}) is used to align the raw reads to the  {species_submitted} genome(s) 
  ({genome_version}), the duplicated fragments are marked using {biobambam_or_samblaster} 
  ({biobambam_or_samblaster_version}) to mark the duplicated fragments, and samtools ({samtools_version}) is used to 
  assess coverage. The BAM file generated by the alignement is discarded and only the fastq files are 
  kept.

bioinformatics_analysis_bcbio: >-
  Demultiplexing is performed using bcl2fastq ({bcl2fastq_version}), allowing 1 
  mismatch when assigning reads to barcodes. Adapters (Read1:  {adapter1}, Read2:  {adapter2}) are trimmed during the 
  demultiplexing process. BCBio-Nextgen ({bcbio_version}) is used to perform alignment, BAM file preparation and variant 
  detection. BCBio uses bwa mem ({bwa_version}) to align the raw reads to the  {species_submitted} genome(s) 
  ({genome_version}), then {biobambam_or_samblaster} ({biobambam_or_samblaster_version}) to mark the duplicated 
  fragments, and the Genome Analysis ToolKit ({gatk_version}) for the indel realignment and base recalibration. 
  The genotype likelihoods are calculated using Genome Analysis Toolkit ({gatk_version}) HaplotypeCaller creating a final 
  gvcf file.

  Genome Analysis Toolkit ({gatk_version}) HaplotypeCaller creating a gvcf file per sample.

yield_and_coverage: >-
  Yield is calculated as the number of in bases provided in the fastq files and is expressed in 
  gigabases (Gb). Coverage is the average number of bases covering each position of the reference 
  genome.

yield_and_coverage_chart: >-
  Chart showing the yield and coverage for {nb_sample} sample(s). The sections 
  in the graph highlight the expected yield ({req_yield} Gb) and the expected coverage ({req_cov}X).

fastq_format: >-
  Files ending in 'fastq.gz' are in gzipped Sanger fastq format, and contain the raw sequence data 
  after demultiplexing. Each sample has two files: an 'R1.fastq.gz' and an 'R2.fastq.gz', respectively containing the 
  first and second reads of each read pair.

bam_format: >-
  Files ending in '.bam' are in BAM format, and contain the reads aligned to the genome and ready for 
  variant calling. Each sample has one BAM file plus a '.bam.bai' file, which is the BAM index. This allows some 
  programmes fast random access to any part of the BAM file.

vcf_format: >-
  Files ending in '.vcf.gz' are gzipped VCF files, and contain variants detected between the sample and 
  the reference genome. There is also a 'g.vcf.gz' file, which contains genotype likelihoods across the genome regardless 
  of the presence of a variant. Files ending in 'vcf.gz.tbi' are Tabix indexes allowing fast random access to any part of 
  their corresponding VCF.
